# 📰 Fake News Detection App

This is a machine learning-powered web application that classifies news articles as **REAL** or **FAKE**. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of an article and predicts its authenticity.

## 🚀 Features

- 🗣️ Classify news as **REAL** or **FAKE**
- ✍️ Input any news article directly in the app
- 📈 Shows confidence score of prediction
- 📦 Built with lightweight, fast Naive Bayes classifier
- 💻 Simple, interactive UI using Streamlit


## 📌 Limitations and Future Improvements

- The model uses TF-IDF and Naive Bayes, which are effective but basic.
- It may misclassify short or out-of-distribution articles.
- No fact-checking is performed — it’s purely text-based classification.
